This is the online home of the weekly half-hour flipped classroom for Crain's employees in Chicago. We meet every Tuesday at noon for a half-hour, unless noted here: **Yes, I'll be there on Tuesday, November 13th.**

Below are either free or very cheap resources on the web. Generally these are all self-directed tutorials with no deadlines.

There is no bad choice here. If you want to get better at Excel and aren't interested in learning to code, that's great. Excel is a powerful tool that I still use all the time. And generally, anything that works in Excel works in Google sheets.

If you'd like to learn to code, either R or Python are good choices. I work in both and the basic concepts are pretty much the same. But if I had to recommend one, R is a bit more accessible to someone just starting out.

## Data Journalism Resources

### Google searches

If you get stuck - and you will get stuck - there are tons of free resources online. Here's two ways to find them via google search:
* Type "stackoverflow:" and your question. Stackoverflow is a website dedicated to answering questions about all these tools. It's huge and has a worldwide reach.
* Type what you want to do ("excel pivot table") and then the word "tutorial."

If those don't work, contact me and we'll figure it out together.

### For Excel

I don't have a lot of resources for Excel. If there's a free or cheap course that you recommend, please let me know and I'll add it here.
* Microsoft has a lot of [free resources online](https://support.office.com/en-us/excel).
* Excel for [Windows training](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/excel-for-windows-training-9bc05390-e94c-46af-a5b3-d7c22f6990bb?wt.mc_id=otc_home&ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US). Useful for Mac as well.
* [Excel Easy](https://www.excel-easy.com/) Seems to have a number of free mini-tutorials for specific skills.
* In this repository, look in the folder called "data" for an excel sheet and exercise prompt, courtesy of [IRE.org](https://ire.org/)

### For R

R is a language specifically designed for statistical analysis. Tons of free stuff out there.

To use it, [install the R language](https://cran.rstudio.com/) and then [install Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). These are free. See me for assistance installing.

Here are the learning resources I recommend:
* [Hands on Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) This book recently became free on the web, so I haven't gone through it yet. But it's part one of a two book set that is widely seen as essential reading - highly recommmended.
* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html) Part two of the essential R books. This one focuses on data analysis and visualizations.
* Alternatively, if you would rather have a self-paced series of video tutorials with exercises, I recommend the Udemy course [R programming for data science](https://www.udemy.com/r-programming/). I did this course and found it very useful. **DO NOT PAY MORE THAN $20 FOR THIS COURSE.** Please see me first about discounts.
* Once I got up and running with R, I put together [this series of tutorials](https://timbroderick.github.io/R_graphics/) for my co-workers and myself (to document what I'd learned), mainly focused on making print-ready graphics with R. Lots of links to cool stuff.
* I sat through [this session](https://paldhous.github.io/NICAR/2017/r-analysis.html) a few years ago and found it very useful. Wait till you learn a bit about R first.

### For Python

Python is a great general-purpose computer language, but also used for data science.

I recommend [installing the Anaconda installation of Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). It includes all the stuff you need to get started. You'll want the latest 3.x version. See me for assistance installing.

Here are the learning resources I recommend:
* [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) is an excellent place to begin. He's also got a cheap Udemy course.
* Here's a guide to analyzing [campaign contributions](http://www.firstpythonnotebook.org/) written by a leader in data journalism.
* [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/), another great book free on the web.

## Web Design Resources

If you have some to suggest, please let me know and I'll include them here.

Note: I do not recommend anything from W3schools.com. It's a content farm that comes up way too often in google searches, but I've never gotten much out of it and always feel like I need to cleanse my computer after looking at one of their pages.

* [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML) is the foundation behind the Firefox browser. Their tutorial series is a decent place to start.
* [Kahn Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css) is a not-for-profit learning site.
* [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) seems to have a number of free tutorials to get you started on web design. I would start with [html and css](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3), and then try [javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript). ***NOTE: I HAVE NOT DONE THESE.*** Try them out as long as they're free, but I wouldn't recommend paying for any courses with out fully vetting the site first.
* [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/web-development) was a good resource when I learned Python, but they've since mixed their free tutorials with paid ones. I would give the free stuff a try first.

&ast; I intended this to be "Crain's Hack", like [chihacknight](), but now I see it's more like "Crain's Shack" which, as a B52s fan, is fine.
