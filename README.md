Free resources on the web (with one exception). Generally these are all self-directed tutorials with no deadlines.

### Resources

**Google searches**
There are tons of free resources online. Here's two ways to find them via google search
* Type "stackoverflow:" and your question. Stackoverflow is a website dedicated to answering questions about all these tools. It's huge and has a worldwide reach.
* Type what you want to do ("excel pivot table") and then the word "tutorial."

**For Excel**
* Microsoft has a lot of [free resources online](https://support.office.com/en-us/excel)
* Excel for [Windows training](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/excel-for-windows-training-9bc05390-e94c-46af-a5b3-d7c22f6990bb?wt.mc_id=otc_home&ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US). Useful for Mac as well
* [Excel Easy](https://www.excel-easy.com/) Seems to have a number of free mini-tutorials

**For R**
Tons of free stuff out there. Here's what I recommend:
* [Hands on Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)This book recently became free on the web, so I haven't gone through it yet. But it's part one of a two book set that is widely seen as essential reading - highly recommmended.
* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html) Part two of the essential R books. This one focuses on data analysis and visualizations.
* Alternatively, if you would rather have a self-paced series of video tutorials with exercises, I recommend the Udemy course [R programming for data science](https://www.udemy.com/r-programming/). I did this course and found it very useful. **DO NOT PAY MORE THAN $20 FOR THIS COURSE.** Please see me first about discounts.
* Once I got up and running with R, I put together [this series of tutorials](https://timbroderick.github.io/R_graphics/) for my co-workers and myself (to document what I'd learned), mainly focused on making print-ready graphics with R. Lots of links to cool stuff.
* I sat through [this session](https://paldhous.github.io/NICAR/2017/r-analysis.html) a few years ago and found it very useful. Wait till you learn a bit about R first.

**For Python**
